# Ecommerce-Customer-Behavior
EDA big data ecommerce customer behavior with pyspark on jupyter notebook
I have about 8 GB of big data in which there are columns and rows related to the habits of e-commerce users. There are 9 columns consisting of event time, event type, product id, category id, category code, brand, price, user id, and user session. In this session I will make an exploratory data analysis to find insights that can be used to develop sales. If you have any questions or maybe you are interested in collaborating, don't hesitate to contact me from the linkedin page in my profile.
